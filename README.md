# Windows Marshmallow
Windows Marshmallow is a compact and simple script for installing various programs. You don't need to install the app you need with hassle. Windows Marshmallow makes your job easy and downloads the program you need directly from the official site and installs it silently.
Windows Marshmallow is open source and developers can enhance this script or use new features to this script (selling and misusing this script is not allowed).

# Usage Training
Get the latest version of the script from the release section. Right-click on the script and run it as an administrator. You can install the program you want by selecting and searching. You can update the apps on your system (avoid updating the cracked apps as the crack may fail)
